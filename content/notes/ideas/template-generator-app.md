Sort of how [Guppy][] is a GUI for React application management, it would be cool to have a similar application that would quickly scaffold out new files, React components, tests, etc. based on templates. It's like a GUI for [Rails Generators][], but you would be able to define your own templates and replace file/class/variable names with user input.
