Here are some songs I've learned about in 2019 (not necessarily _released_ in 2019) that I'm listening to:

- [Solange - "Jerrod"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BJj7cd4Vic)
- [Walter Wanderley - Rainforest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWdNiGS1Qtw)
- [Gil Scott-Heron - "Lady Day and John Coltrane"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aRNUsmfeck)
