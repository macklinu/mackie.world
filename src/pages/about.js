              I have experience with Android and full-stack web engineering
              (Node.js, TypeScript, React), with job experiences ranging from
              startups in San Francisco to large companies in Detroit and
              throughout the United States, both in-person and remote. In
              addition to this experience, I have also contributed to various
              open source software projects, such as maintaining a couple of
              widely used ESLint plugins for a period of time
