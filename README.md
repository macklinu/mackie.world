> :earth_americas: a website built with Gatsby :earth_americas:

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

## Commands

- `yarn` - install dependencies
- `yarn dev` - start a Gatsby dev server
- `yarn build` - build a production-ready static site ready to be deployed (usually run by Netlify but sometimes can be helpful to verify something locally)

## Workspaces

This project uses [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/workspace/) to split out packages for more organized development (and also because I want to use yarn workspaces). Check out the `packages/` directory for more details:

- `components` - the design system for this website
