Instead of embedding tweets into a blog post, why not embed an image of the tweet instead?

- take a screenshot of a provided tweet URL using [puppeteer][]
- use that image in place of a tweet embed
- clicking the image will take you to the tweet source

[puppeteer]: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer
