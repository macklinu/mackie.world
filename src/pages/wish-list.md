# Wish List

I have been told that I'm hard to buy presents for, so if you're seeing this, you may be looking for ideas.

## Music Gear

[Sweetwater](https://www.sweetwater.com) is where I buy most of my music gear, and a [gift card](https://www.sweetwater.com/shop/gift-cards/) will always help flesh out my studio.

Here are some small to medium priced things that I would like.

- [Drum stick caddy](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/StickCaddy--vic-firth-drum-stick-caddy)
- [Bass drum mic stand](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/MicStdDeskBm--on-stage-stands-ms7920b-bass-drum-boom-combo-mic-stand)
- [Desktop mic stand](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/MicStdDesk--on-stage-stands-ds7200b-adjustable-height-desktop-stand)
- [Boom mic stand (2-pack)](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/KM21090-2pk--k-and-m-210-9-telescoping-boom-microphone-stand-2-pack)
- [Tripod mic stand](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/KM25900B--k-and-m-25900-black)
- [Walrus Audio Julia v2 pedal](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/JuliaChorusV2--walrus-audio-julia-v2-analog-chorus-vibrato-pedal)

## Clothing

Sports jerseys are always a hit. I love the Detroit Tigers, Pistons, Lions, and Red Wings. I also wouldn't say no to a Michigan Wolverines football or basketball jersey. A [custom throwback jersey](https://customthrowbackjerseys.com/) would be pretty sick. I prefer size XL for jerseys.

Carhartt size L loose fit short sleeve or long sleeve shirts are staples in my dresser. I like lots of different colors, but black and white are always safe bets.
