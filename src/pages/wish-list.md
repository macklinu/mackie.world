# Wish List

I have been told that I'm hard to buy presents for, so if you're seeing this, you may be looking for ideas. Here are some things that I would always love to have or can put to good use.

## Music Gear

[Sweetwater](https://www.sweetwater.com) is where I buy most of my music gear, and a [gift card](https://www.sweetwater.com/shop/gift-cards/) will always help flesh out my studio.

## Clothing

Sports jerseys are always a hit. I love the Detroit Tigers, Pistons, Lions, and Red Wings. I also wouldn't say no to a Michigan Wolverines football or basketball jersey. A [custom throwback jersey](https://customthrowbackjerseys.com/) would be pretty sick. I prefer size XL for jerseys.

Carhartt size L loose fit short sleeve or long sleeve shirts are staples in my dresser. I like lots of different colors, but black and white are always safe bets.
